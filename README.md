# K-Nearest-Neighbors
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple yet powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the closest data points (neighbors) to a given input and making predictions based on their majority class (for classification) or average value (for regression).
